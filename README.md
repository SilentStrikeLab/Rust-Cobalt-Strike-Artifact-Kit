# Rust-Cobalt-Strike-Artifact-Kit

#Overview
Rust Artifact Kit is a sophisticated research framework demonstrating advanced evasion techniques through Rust-based artifact loaders. This project serves as an educational resource for blue teams, security researchers, and incident responders to understand modern loader methodologies and develop effective detection strategies.

Important: This project is for DEFENSIVE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. All code is provided as non-executable pseudocode to prevent misuse while enabling thorough defensive analysis.

Key Features
Zero Static Imports: Runtime API resolution via PEB walking and hash-based lookup

Dual-Section Memory Operations: Separate RW (read-write) and RX (execute-read) views eliminating RWX permission flags

Fiber-Based Execution: Threadless execution avoiding common thread creation signatures

CNA Integration: Marker-based patching system for flexible payload integration

Modern Evasion Techniques: Research implementation of advanced evasion methodologies
